## Human readable workflows with error handling made easy.

Express your workflows in explicit form so anyone can understand and/or write them:

```typescript
type ParseStringToNumberError = {
    message: string;
};

type ParseStringToNumber = (_: string) => Either<ParseStringToNumberError, number>;
type NumberProcessor = (_: number) => number;
type NumberFormatter = (_: number) => string;

type FancyWorkflow = Workflow<[ParseStringToNumber, NumberProcessor, NumberFormatter]>;
```

- `FancyWorkflow` is statically validated and it's result will be `Either<ParseStringToNumberError, string>`.
- If we mess up your stages inputs and outputs or mix `sync`/`async` type your workflow will have `never` type so you cannot do anything with it.

Write the implementation of the stages elsewhere not to scare/bore the business team and run your workflow by:
```typescript
const fancyWorkflow: FancyWorkflow = [parseStringToNumber, numberProcessor, numberFormatter];
const fancyWorkflowResult = runWorkflow(fancyWorkflow)("42"); 
// fancyWorkflowResult is type is Either<ParseStringToNumberError, string> as parsing string into number can fail
```
Don't need to worry if the previous step is an async operation or can fail all of these are handled automatically so you can focus on writing your stages in separation.
